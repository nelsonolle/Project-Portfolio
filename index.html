            Hello! My name is Nelson! I am an aspiring computer programmer and I am starting my journey with a web development course. Although I am just getting started in the world of programming I am fairly comfortable navigating computers and building them. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Aside from learning programming, my current current dayjob consists of building stainless steel furniture and products. And by night I am a music maker, working in multiple digital audio workstations, playing the piano and guitar.
