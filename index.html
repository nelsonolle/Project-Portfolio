                Hello! My name is Nelson. I am an aspiring computer programmer and I am starting my journey with a web development course. Although I am just getting started in the world of programming I am fairly comfortable navigating computers and building them.

            <p>
                Aside from learning programming, my current current dayjob consists of building stainless steel furniture and products. And by night I am a music maker, working in multiple digital audio workstations, playing the piano and guitar.
